    <p><b>Scenary Image -</b> <br> <em>It’s the whale-watching season here on the coast of Massachusetts and these humpback whales
    and their seagull friends are on a feeding frenzy. Here’s a little tip if you ever find yourself seeking out 
    humpbacks – look for birds. Where there are swarms of dive-bombing birds, there will be fish, and where they are fish, 
    there may be humpback whales. It appears this pod of humpbacks is engaged in ‘bubble-net feeding,’ a phenomenon that 
    involves the whales diving below a school of fish and then blowing bubbles as they twirl back up. The bubbles corral 
    the disoriented fish in a 'net,' allowing the whales to gobble up mouthfuls as they rise to the surface.
    It's an ingenious way to catch prey. This is the feeding season after all, and these whales spend up to 20 hours a day
    eating 1 to 1.5 tons of krill and small fish. As for the seagulls pictured here, they certainly appear happy to take part 
    in the feast. Bon Appetit!</em></p>

    <p><em>Is it just us or does this porcini mushroom look straight out of a fairytale? These popular 
    mushrooms (also known as king bolete or cèpe in French) are cultivated in Europe, North America, and parts of Asia, and 
    grow naturally in pine forests at the base of trees. Autumn is porcini season in central Europe, with much of 
    the carefully picked harvest dried for later consumption or export. Fresh porcini are beloved by gourmet chefs 
    and can be sautéed and eaten as a side dish or added to risottos and pasta, while the dried mushrooms add rich flavour 
    to broths and stews.</em><br>
